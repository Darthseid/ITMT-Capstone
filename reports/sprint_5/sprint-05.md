#### Automation
        ## Acquiring GIT Project
        git clone https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/2020-team13w.git
        or
        if having issues with cloning due to access, deploy ssh key to avoid any problems
            - open powershell type: ssh-keygen
            - press "enter" twice 
            - next type: ls ~/.ssh to view files
            - next type: cat ~/.ssh.id_rsa.pub
            - copy from powershell the key
            - go to the git project you want to view and look at settings/deploy keys
            - click on add deploy key, give a title of machine accessing and paste key into key box
            - do not check box and press add key
            - go back to powershell and type git clone git@github.com:illinoistech-itm/2020-team13w
            - press enter and you should be good to go on acquiring the project
