# Developer Report

## Sample code from the developer is on his private repo
   ### https://github.com/Darthseid/ITMT-Capstone/tree/master/Project_Examples

# IT Infrastructure Report: Jorell Socorro

- Choose between mongoDB or mysql database 
- List all devices we will test on
    - Webcam provided by professor
    - Virtual machines to create server
    - Old model laptops provided by professor
    - Cell Phone devices

# Developer and Security Assumptions: Mike Kotlyar

- Two assumptions for security:
   - Outdated Software
      - Find devices that have outdated software that will show up in a scan
      - Checking the model number to see if any company still keeps things updated
   - Enable services
      - Provide services for the outdated software or give advice on how to handle it 
   - Default user/password
      - How easy it is to grab the admin password and user to access the desktop
   - Network work arounds
      - port forwarding to see if it is able to access lets say, smartcam, through the network it is connected to

# Atomic Goals for Sprint-02

## Project Manager
- Ask for each member's phone numbers since slack is more of a social app
- Use the browser organization for tasks more
- Set up a schedule to meet more than once a week which is lab time

## IT Infrastructure
- Obtaining all of the devices for the upcoming sprint
   - Once devices have been obtained will setup with networks
- Finally deciding a database and cooperate with the developer
   - Database between mongoDB or mysql 
- Webcam should be the first device to be tested if it was located in the nmaps

## UI/UX 
- Test out UI/UX 
	- Use Power point mock up to test with friends and acquaintances and modify user experience
    - Use the feedback to improve and show some interactive designs
- Start interactive mobile experience with mock ups using Android Studios
	- Learn how to connect python with Android Studios 
	- Have some main pages ready for test
- Start interactive web site experience using HTML & CSS
	- Learn how to connect python back end with HTML & CSS 
	- Have at least the core pages ready with HTML
   
## Developer
   - Test the sample program that was created that is related to our project
      - url to the repository to test out the program is linked in this readme
   - will be using IDLE to test out the program
   - Once completed will cooperate with the IT infrastructure for the backend database
      - Hopefully will create a basic structure on how the backend should look like, a sample image of backend is already uploaded

## Cyber Security 
   - Provide more information on different situations that relates to vulnerable devices
      - many articles that will be used to display when a user is using the program
   - Run different tests to see how vulnerable the devices are shown in the open source programs like nmaps
      - after running tests come up with different solutions to fix certain vulnerbilities
   - Test out the two different assumptions that was mentioned here in the first sprint
